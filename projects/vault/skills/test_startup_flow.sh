echo -e "${BLUE}📋 Startup Flow Test Checklist:${NC}"
echo ""

echo "1. ✅ Unified Application State"
echo "   - Single appState object managing startup and device state"
echo "   - Comprehensive device state tracking (connected, features, status, error)"
echo "   - Clear startup progression tracking"
echo ""

echo "2. ✅ Improved Event System"
echo "   - device:connected - Basic device connection event"
echo "   - device:ready - Device with features loaded and ready"
echo "   - device:disconnected - Device removal event"
echo "   - device:features-updated - Features update event"
echo "   - device:access-error - Device access/permission errors"
echo "   - application:startup - Backend monitoring initialization"
echo "   - application:restart - Backend restart events"
echo ""

echo "3. ✅ Backend Improvements"
echo "   - Event controller proactively fetches device features"
echo "   - Comprehensive error handling for device access issues"
echo "   - Timeout protection for feature fetching"
echo "   - Better device state change notifications"
echo ""

echo "4. ✅ Frontend Improvements"
echo "   - Checks for existing devices on startup (no more race conditions)"
echo "   - Unified state management with helper functions"
echo "   - Better error handling and user feedback"  
echo "   - Clearer startup progression messages"

echo ""
echo "1. Start Vault V2:"
echo "   cd /Users/highlander/keepkey-bitcoin-only/projects/vault"
echo "   npm run tauri dev"
echo ""
echo "2. Test scenarios:"
echo "   a) Start with device already connected"
echo "   b) Start without device, then connect"
echo "   c) Disconnect and reconnect device"
echo "   d) Test with device in use by another app"
echo "   e) Click logo to restart backend"
echo ""

echo -e "${GREEN}🎯 Expected Behavior:${NC}"
echo ""
echo "• Startup Status Progression:"
echo "  1. 'Initializing application...'"
echo "  2. 'Scanning for connected devices...'"
echo "  3. 'Device detected – fetching features...'"
echo "  4. 'Device ready' → Shows VaultInterface"
echo ""
echo "• Error States:"
echo "  - 'Device in use by another app' (with helpful dialog)"
echo "  - 'Failed to communicate with device'"
echo "  - 'Device disconnected – waiting for reconnection...'"
echo ""

echo -e "${BLUE}📊 Key Improvements Made:${NC}"
echo ""
echo "✅ Race Condition Fix: Check for existing devices on startup"
echo "✅ Unified State: Single appState object instead of scattered variables" 
echo "✅ Better Messaging: Clear startup progression and error states"
echo "✅ Event Consolidation: Backend sends comprehensive device info"
echo "✅ Proactive Features: Backend fetches features automatically"
echo "✅ Error Handling: Comprehensive device access error management"
echo "✅ State Functions: Helper functions for clean state updates"

echo -e "${GREEN}🎉 Startup Process Review Complete!${NC}"
echo ""
echo "The improved startup process now provides:"
echo "• Better user experience with clear progression messages"
echo "• Reliable device detection without race conditions"
echo "• Comprehensive error handling and user guidance" 
echo "• Unified state management for easier maintenance"
echo "• Efficient event system with consolidated messaging"
